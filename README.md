# Efficient-Core-Maintenance-in-Dynamic-Graphs

The goal of this project is to propose a new algorithm for time efficient core maintenance of dynamic graphs.

Here is the Code for the Project in Java.

You can run the project as a normal Java Program by building the program and running the code.

Datasets are encoded to the code, so the dataset names must be changed in this program.

Parameters are also encoded in the code it selt.
